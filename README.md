# Project Cavebots

This project is a story idea I've had at the back of my mind for much too long.

The main purpose has been to simply type down this story and get it out of my head. Ideally while finding out if it's actually a good story. To get the best sense of this, I've written this in Swedish, my mother tongue, as far as possible, to detect words or phrases that are actually corny or silly, but sound cool to me in english.

A secondary purpose has been to push my knowledge of web components and the "vanilla" HTML, CSS and JS and go with the flow the browser gives you. As such, this project intentionally have zero dependencies, and are navigated trough using good old web navigation. Navigate to ./script/index.html to find the starting point.

I have bundled two prototype ideas with this project, to get a sense if the combat had potential, available in ./prototypes . The first is a pen-and-paper prototype that I've been able to test with real players. The most common feedback was the playtesters wanted a digital component to handle resource management, so that's the origins of the second prototype. Lacking a clear boundry and assumptions, it slowed my ideation down, and the idea of the prototype scope creeped, so at the time of typing I've lost the desire to complete said prototype.

In a bid to figure out Figma, I'm using it to mock up how this story would look as a visual novel.
