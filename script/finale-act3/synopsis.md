# Synopsis for Act 3 / Finale

## Fortress
With the band back together, the team can finally confront the Golems and end the war.

The team gathers in the Fortress - now a thriving city as well as fortress true to its name - to make a plan.

The group has two immediate objectives - confront the golems, and stop the war before the looming battle breaks out in earnest. There is not a lot of time, and both objectives will be difficult.
So how do they solve this?
En, Sophia and Temperantia are deep in thought. Andrei and Fortitudo throw out ideas, all of which involves combat. Festina suggests flipping the script, and trapping the Golems between the armies to force a stalemate. Curiosity then asks "Why not just call them, and hear them out? We got sufficient defences here to force them out should a fight break out."

"We can do that? That would solve so many problems."
"Wait, they've done nothing but stand in our way. Why would they be open to help us out?"
Festina: "We can't just _invite_ them, this is supposed to be a secret hideout! They'd know where we live"
Curiosity: "Wait, you still think that? I thought you had this figured out"
Festina: "Figured this out? Wait, you don't mean..."

As she says this, there is an incoming alarm from the gate keeps - "Sirs, an unidentified group just showed up unannounced at the gates. They claim you want to see them. Please confirm."
Curiosity asks for a description
"Well, they look a lot like stone slabs that walk by some magic stuff piecing them together"
Curisoty replies "I'll come and meet them by the entrance"
And, before he leaves, adds "Please don't view this as a betrayal, guys. I'm positive you'll appreciate this by the time they leave".

As he's away, the others can't help but feel a bit upset anyway. He went ahead of them and _called them_ - _here_ - without even getting their agreement! They settle into trusting his call; he's figured things out before they have all this time, after all.

Curiosity comes back, Golems in tow, who fit through the doors surprisingly well for their size.
The golem leader starts speaking first. They have tested the Androids consistently over their adventures, and have the answers they wanted. Now they wish to know if the Androdis have theirs.

First, they ask, have the Androids figured out why the Golems have been testing them like this? Andrei states they've been tested for strength and tactics, and Sophia that they've been tested for if their loyalty to humanity remains.
The Golems nod, but also ask Curiosity. While he hasn't been there, that fact suggests to him it's also to measure them up to the Androids of old, and how well they figure things out on their own.

To this the Golems note their picture is almost complete, but missing a crucial piece: If they can simply walk into the Fortress, with the whole crew assembled, without fearing a fight, why do they think they didn't take them out while they were alone, or moved on the Fortress while they were away?
Festina is the one to say the quiet part out loud: The Golems were never hostile, and there is something here they all had to see together.

"That is indeed the case. I'd like to show you why that is, an answer that resides within these very walls. Would you like to escort us there?"
The Androids agree and form a escort procession around the Androids - awkwardly, since it's the escorted dictating where to go - and come to a door they've yet opened. The Golems press their hands to buttons tailor-made for them.
They enter a large elevator, and activate it to descend.
"Have you ever looked into the details of that age you were gone? While the world after the Man-Machine war was a barren wasteland, man and machine found unexpected new ways to collaborate. What came out of it, over centurites, was a time of magic and wonders, and of prosperity never before known. We just called it a Reinnesense at the time, but these days we know it as the Arcane Age."
"As the last remains of the Age of Steel, we eventually found our role to guide and coach the powers that were. A sort of custodians and gardeners for the new world. And when our mechanical bodies slowly grew rusty and needed repairs, the peoples provided us something they found fit our roles better."
"Anyway, civilization of this Reinnesanse eventually found ways to not just fly, but to reach for the stars. And that was to be the beginning of their end"
"Because while we had gone to hell and back, the old colonists had developed at the speed we would had the Man-Machine war never occurred, into what we call the Stellars, and developed means to observe us from orbit and, it would turn out, to bombard us. They held the high ground, and were determined to drown us in fire."
"They hunted us down best they could - you weren't around to be hunted, as you may know - but we managed to stay alive. Yet when they were done, the destruction was unlike any we've ever seen - Man-Machine war included. And so, we realized that if civilization ever recovered again, it would need means to fight off the Stellars should they ever return"
"Which turned into... this"

As they say this, a massive chamber comes into view from the elevantor. Large missile silos cover the chamber, with a central apparatus seemingly designed to fetch any of them and fire towards the heavens.

"While they hold the high ground, and would likely rather drown us in another fire than yield it, we found a way to shoot them down should we need it. A cannon large enough to fire bullets into higher orbits, and if our simulations are correct, a way for said bullets to them intercept and down any ship they would throw at us."
"To keep this available, we designed an installation large enough to defend it from any kind of attack we could think of, and hide a metropolis large enough to support it for perpetuity should it ever be sieged."

"Or as we've learned you call it, the Fortress. A fitting name, actually."

The androids are awed. They had never guessed they sat on top of something this important, or that the Golems held these keys.

"Hold on, let me get this straight." Sophia finally asks. "You've built a hidden metropolis fortress, with a hidden cannon capable of fighting even the most far-flung enemy, only to abandon it to a group that has reason to find you hostile, give them new reason to do so, and scatter yourselves to the wind? And now you return, once said group are firmly entrenched and consolidated, and profess friendship? Why would I believe any of this, rather than just call some guards and imprison you forever?"

"Well, there is one more thing. It wouldn't make much sense unless we showed this first - still might not, actually. Please hear me out one more time, and if you're not still uncertain, I'll willingly go to that prison you mentioned. I think I know the way."

"Well, at least you're a master of hooks. Shoot."

They walk back to the elevator, and start ascending back.

"When the Stellars ended the Arcane Age, it wasn't simply orbital bombardment. They must have had their fair share of politics, conflicts and wars, because they had ways to get down the atmosphere, and patrol the skies. They likely have ways to monitor the seas and land, as well, even if we're as of yet aware of them. As we resisted, we found that while the simple "soldier units" were fully autonomous, the units organizing them - the "officer units" or knights, if you will - were piloted. By androids."
"So we figured, if we could recover these knights, perhaps we could turn them over to defend humanity. And if we could do that, who would be the perfect pilots to defend humanity? Why, the only ones who bested us, so long ago in the Man-Machine war!"

"There was just a minor detail. Time waits for no one, and while we sustained ourselves with changing metal with stones, those Androids of eld were locked away in statis. By the time we found them, they had rusted beyond repair, and any interface or protocol used in those days had been lost to time. The best we could do was reverse-engineer the parts we had experienced with records we could find, and hope they restored themselves correctly. And when they did not, we had to eliminate them, evaluate and iterate."

The elevator reaches its destination. The floor they came from. The Golems take a turn... away from the entrance.

"Of course, as we got closer to personalities resembling those Androids, we realized the obvious. The Androids viewed us as mortal enemies, and the whole plan could backfire spectacularly. They needed a way to get the right impressions and experiences to open up for persuation. And so, we laid the breadcrumbs for your breadcrumbs, ever monitoring you terminate you should we have to. That is the antagonism you've experienced so far.

The androids are shocked. How could they accept this story, when they've done nothing but obstruct and hunted them?

"May I finally speak now?" Curiosity asks the Golems, and recieves a nod of approval. He had figured it out in the blink of an eye of awakening, but had been warned into silence. They've been testing your progress. Note how they left clear holes for us to defeat them by, and challenged them to open duels rather than overwhelming ambushes? And how every time they obstructed us, we went out into the world and discovered something about it that let us win next time. He had wanted to tell you, but was strictly warned not to. Thankfully, he got interested in the Fortress instead, and got too distracted. 

They've been tracking their way back some awfully familiar corridors, spider webby as they are.

The story sinks in, but they naturally still harbour doubts. So of course they ask for proof.

"Simple", the first Golem says, "our whole story hinges upon two truths, does it not? First, that you really are the Androids of old - even though you should have noticed how impossible that must be"

"Yeah..", Festina notes solemnly, "I could only build my network thanks to the legends I - no, previous Festinas - had left behind"

They reach a familiar chamber - the one with the pods where they first woke up!

One of the golems cast an invokation, effectively saying "lights on!" - the room lights up, and they spot that the pods were never attached to any wall, but to Light Knights, who without their blinding radiance turns out to be very large mechas.
"And secondly: These. If what we've told you is true, you are able to pilot these Knights. Something the Androids of old would never have been able to, since the Stellar federation had yet to form, and the Light Knights not even imaginable at their time."

"Let me tell you, hunting these down were no easy feat. It's really a story for another time, and maybe a skill we should teach you. Having more of these would be invaluable should the Stellars decide to come back in force."

"But for now: Climb in, claim your Knight, and you should have all the proof you need".

--- Side-conversation ---
But Sophia is still suspicous. "Hold on a second. By Ockham's Razor, the far simpler story is someone installed an update to let us drive these"

"Now who would that be? You did admit you noticed The Androids and Elites of the Man-Machine war are legends. These times don't have the means to maintain such technology. Who would have been able to write them such an update?"

"And if the Androids' survival are such an impossibility, how did you survive then?" Sophia continues

"You assume we have, but we're not so sure. We've changed so many parts, so much of what we were, the only thing remaining from that time are our names".
---
En takes the risk of being the first, climbs back into the tube they woke up from. To their surprise, they see the grips for hands and click-ins for the feet, and buttons lighting up in front of them. As they click something familiar, telling them to activate, a construction at the back lifts them up around their core a decimeter or so to keep them suspended mid-air with no tension, thus allowing frictionless movement of arms and legs. The cockpit closes, and the visor descends over the cockpit, revealing a dashboard of monitors on its inside with all kinds of views and sensors. "Woah", En gasps, "small wonder they could always see where we were!"

Around this time, the others have climbed into their cockpits as well, while the Golems have snuck out to the entrance.

"I'm sure you're thinking of a grant sortie, or turning on us, but I'm sure you've noticed this is a workshop. If any one of you open fire right now, you will only end each other."

En has to ask, of course - "What do you say, team?"
Andrei: "I don't see any clear flaws in their story, but this is a lot to take in."
Sophia: "You could say that. We're not who we always believed we were, they were never the enemy, knew our self-styled home better than we did - heck, they _built_ the place - and all for a cause we've just begun to understand?"
Andrei: "The cause is the same as always, though? To protect humanity. Even if these Stellars are humans, doesn't change the fact the people here are _our_ humans?"
Temperantia: "So we have a country now? As I recall, 'humanity' always referred to _all of_ humanity."
Fortitudo: "But if what the Golems say is true - and I believe them - then these are the humanity we _can_ protect. Even if the Stellars are humans, they seem neither in need of our protection, nor within reach for us to protect. In fact, they sound more like the primary existential threat the humans we can protect face. And allying with the Golems would serve that aim better than stay opponents."
Andrei: "Well said, Temp."
Curiosity: "I for one drew the same conclusion Fortitudo just did, and I'm sorry I couldn't tell you. I've done all I can to speed up your progress to this point, but lke they said, you had to get here on your own"
Festina: "Well, can't say I never suspected anything - an information gathering network tends to make you informed, after all. Still, they could never have guessed the story went this deep or far back. I'm impressed, more than anything!"
Temperantia: "I agree with Fortitudo, allying with the Golems to protect the humanity we can aligns best with the spirit with our mission, and maybe one day we can extend this protection to the Stellars themselves"
Sophia: "I suppose we did see the world like they asked. We saw the state humanity is in, or at least some of it. To me the goal is clear - we need to settle this conflict. Just give me the time to work through this identity crisis afterwards."
En: "Sounds we're in agreement. "

"Golems - makers, imagined old foes, newfound friends - we agree to assist you and once again take up our old mantle, no matter if it's imagined or real."

A wave of relief sweeps through the group at the entrance.

"Finally. Then let's get your Knights to the hangar. We've got a battle to prevent!"

## Field of last stands

After the Golems and Androids moved the Light Knights to a proper hangar, the two teams set off, one Golem riding with each Android's knight. They start mobilizing the entire fortress, but make sure to be the vanguard themselves. They all fly off to a field (of some sort - it's important somehow, but I don't bother to figure out how just now) where the Empire and Kingdom have set up for an important battle. They arrive by early nightfall, rendering light upon a wide field with palpable tension.

The Kingdom have taken very defensible positions along some strategic point the Empire would have to breach. The generals still work by their warfighting logic, but since we've changed the leadership on both sides to friends open to peace, the plan is to simply keep the forces apart until the leaders can arrive and talk them down - with some potential encouragement from no less then seven light knights.

The first objective is to simply push the sides back without panicking. Just one knight is cause for untold havoc, and here's a whole flight of them. This turns a bit into an exercise of herding sheep, using loudspeakers to warn, and some warning shots to demonstrate power and willingness to use it. This successfully cause the Empire soldiers to back off and cause a wide enough corridor to prevent any immediate exchange of fire.

The second objective is to patrol this space while waiting for leadership of Empire, Kingdom _and_ City to show up - which Temperantia, Fortiitudo and Festina is sent to respective camp to ensure - and design a proposal all sides can prefer over continue fighting. Sophia, Curiosity and some of the Golems focus on the latter, leaving En and Andrei to patrol the new "no man's land" they've made to ensure nobody gets funny ideas until the rest of the Fortress staff join them to assist. Said assistance is also meant to display "we can outgun you no matter where you go".

Eventually, Temp returns with the general from the Kingdom and the new King (or was it Prince? I can't recall right now), Forti returns with the Imperial general and the newly crowned Empress, and Festina returns with the City's Mayor.

Sophia takes the word first: "Welcome, royals and representatives. I'll speak plain - this conflict has gone on long enough. We all know your predecessors were open to keep this up, and also that you are more open to change that. While we're humble to the fact we would not be here were there a simple solution, we have made a draft we hope serves as a starting point. Before you see the proposal, I'd like to give the floor to the Golem Leader, who will explain the wider context we see."

The golem leader takes the word: "Thank you. To begin with a reminder, the world was thoroughly shaken by the end of the Arcane Age. While we like to think of our continent, and the order here on, there are others. We don't know how they fared, but we fear they did better, and that any of them could divide and conquer us if we let them. There are also the hordes in the north, who are on the move. Lastly, the force causing the end of the Arcane Age - the Stellar Federation - are still watching us closely from orbit, and seem bent to keep us disorganized. To throw them off, we must defeat them in those aims. It is with these things in mind we ask you read this proposal."
