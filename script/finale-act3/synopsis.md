# Synopsis for Act 3 / Finale

With the band back together, the team can finally confront the Golems and end the war.

The team gathers in the Fortress - now a thriving city as well as fortress true to its name - to make a plan.
However, the meeting gets interrupted when the Golems bust in with Curiosity in tow.
They've tested the Androids consistently over their adventures, and have the answers they wanted. Now they wish to test if the Androdis have theirs.

First, they ask, have the Androids figured out why the Golems have been prodding at them? Andrei states they've been tested for strength and tactics, and Sophia that they've been tested for if their loyalty to humanity remains.
The Golems nod, but also ask Curiosity. He can't know, of course - he hasn't been there - but wager to guess it's also to measure them to the Androids of old and how well they get intel on their own.

To this the Golems note the picture is almost complete, but missing a crucial piece: If they can enter the Fortress now, the whole crew assembled, without resistance, why do they think they didn't take them out while they were alone, or moved on the Fortress while they were away?
This has the Androids thinking for a while, but Festina is the one to figure this out: The Golems were never hostile, and there is something here they all had to see together.

The Golem leader looks equal parts surprised and happy about the answer and suggest they follow him. The golems bring the androids further into the Fortress, towards a door they've yet opened, and press their hands to buttons tailor-made for the Golems.
They enter a large elevator, and on the way down the leader explains: The golems oversaw the world during the Arcane age, and saw it thrive. However, once it embarked upon the stars, the Stellars showed up and made the world a wasteland.
The golems themselves survived, and realized they needed a plan to beat them back should the world ever be free of this threat.
So they built a cannon large enough to sink a whole fleet should they need to, with sufficient material to defend it from any attacker.
And some escape tunnel to get anywhere else should that not be enough.

As they say this, a massive chamber comes into view from the elevantor. Large missile silos cover the chamber, with a central apparatus seemingly designed to fetch any of them and fire towards the heavens.

The fortress, they reveal, is that cannon.

The androids are awed. They had never guessed they sat on top of something this important, or that the Golems held these keys.

One of them can't help but ask, why this sudden change of heart? They opened up being hostile, even kidnapped Curiosity, but now they suddenly tell them all this just as they were planning to confront them? 

To this, they have another thing to show, and another place they have to be. As they take the elevator back up, the Golem leader starts to tell a story:

Soon after the Arcane age ended, they found a means to defend against the Stellars. But needed pilots suitable to that role, and they could imagine none better to the role than the Androids who once defeated them to do just that.
However, those Androids had long rusted and dilapidated, and their successors were rusted husks of the real things, as well as computationally restrained to lack the character and experience the original Androids.
So as they found bits and pieces in good condition, to assemble prime samples of the Android models, they also painstakingly reverse-engineered their personalities back.

The elevator reaches its destination. The floor they came from. The Golems take a turn... away from the entrance.

As they progressed, they started to remember there was a major risk involved. Should they reawaken the perfect copy, said copy would view them as mortal enemies, and the whole plan could backfire spectacularly.
So they needed to travel the world, while monitored of course, and be left to figure things out for themselves before being ready to listen.

The androids are shocked. How could they accept this story, when they've done nothing but obstruct and hunted them?

"May I finally speak now?" Curiosity asks the Golems, and recieves a nod of approval. He had figured it out in the blink of an eye of awakening, but had been warned into silence. They've merely been testing your progress. Note how they just left you be when they bested you, rather than finish you off like an enemy would. And note how every time they obstructed you, you went out into the world and discovered something about it. He had wanted to tell you, but was strictly warned not to. Thankfully, he got interested in the Fortress instead, and got too distracted. 

The story sinks in, but they naturally still harbour doubts. So of course they ask for proof.

They've been tracking their way back some awfully familiar corridors, spider webby as they are.

"Simple", the first Golem says, "our whole story hinges upon two truths, does it not? First, that you really are the Androids of old - even though you should have noticed how impossible that must be"
--- Side-conversation ---
Festina notes, "Yeah.. I could only build my network thanks to the legends I - no, Festina's - had left behind"
---
The chamber with the pods where they first woke up. One of the golems cast an invokation, effectively saying "lights on!" - the room lights up, and they spot that the pods were never attached to any wall, but to Light Knights, who without their blinding radiance turns out to be very large mechas.
"And secondly: These. If what we've told you is true, you are able to pilot these Knights. Something the Androids of old would never have been able to, since the Stellar federation had yet to form, and the Light Knights not even imaginable at their time."

The Golem tell the story how they very slowly, and over time, manages to set traps for Light Knight, isolate them, defeat them, then drag them to the Fortress to salvage them. These would be invaluable should the Stellars decide to come back in force.

"So climb in, activate your Knight, and you should have all evidence you need".

--- Side-conversation ---
But Sophia is still suspicous. "Hold on a second. By Ockham's Razor, the far simpler story is someone installed an update to let us drive these"

"Now who would that be? You did admit you noticed The Androids and Elites of the Man-Machine war are legends. These times don't have the means to maintain such technology. Who would have been able to write them such an update?"

"And if the Androids' survival are such an impossibility, how did you survive then?" Sophia continues

"We're not sure we have. We've suffered many defeats, changed so many parts, so much of what we were, the only thing remaining from that time are our names".

En takes the risk of being the first, climbs back into the tube they woke up from. To their surprise, they see the grips for hands and click-ins for the feet, and buttons lighting up in front of them. As they click something familiar, telling them to activate, a construction at the back lifts them up around their core a decimeter or so to keep them suspended mid-air with no tension, thus allowing frictionless movement of arms and legs.
