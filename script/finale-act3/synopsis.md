# Synopsis for Act 3 / Finale

## "One Pager" Brief

With all the androids gathered, they start making plans on how to confront the Golems and somehow prevent the coming battle to make peace. But they barely start their discussions before the Golems themselves walk in and interrupt the meeting. They proceed to basically take charge of the group while dropping realizations on them, and convince them to join forces. Not only that, they introduce the Androids to Light Knights, which works as proof of the Golems sincerity.

With this new-found power and unity, they take flight to the fields where the early skirmishes is taking place. By forcing the sides apart, and using the new-crowned prince/king and empress to their advantage, and pressing the presence of external threats, they find enough political will to give peace discussions another try. The armies are asked to stand down, but barely manage to do so before (actual) Light Knights show up and try to rip things up again. Unlike last time, this time they have enough organization and trust to fight them off, which serves as even more proof about the external threats and the pressing need to settle this dispute.

Five year later, En arrives by train from Kingdom capital in the Fortress, where the final peace agreement is being signed. It's a bright and living city these days, with established infrastructure to all corners of the continent. While walking the venue, they check in with all their Android friends, the king/prince, empress and mayor, and all the other friends they've made along the way.

After the signing ceremony, all the Androids meet up, move cheerfully walk through the Fortress - people and androids of all colours bowing and saluting along the way - to their Light Knights, and take to the skies. The End.

## Less Brief

### Fortress
With the band back together, the team can finally confront the Golems and end the war.

The team gathers in the Fortress - now a thriving city as well as fortress true to its name - to make a plan.

The group has two immediate objectives - confront the golems, and stop the war before the looming battle breaks out in earnest. There is not a lot of time, and both objectives will be difficult.
So how do they solve this?
En, Sophia and Temperantia are deep in thought. Andrei and Fortitudo throw out ideas, all of which involves combat. Festina suggests flipping the script, and trapping the Golems between the armies to force a stalemate. Curiosity then asks "Why not just call them, and hear them out? We got sufficient defences here to force them out should a fight break out."

"We can do that? That would solve so many problems."
"Wait, they've done nothing but stand in our way. Why would they be open to help us out?"
Festina: "We can't just _invite_ them, this is supposed to be a secret hideout! They'd know where we live"
Curiosity: "Wait, you still think that? I thought you had this figured out"
Festina: "Figured this out? Wait, you don't mean..."

As she says this, there is an incoming alarm from the gate keeps - "Sirs, an unidentified group just showed up unannounced at the gates. They claim you want to see them. Please confirm."
Curiosity asks for a description
"Well, they look a lot like stone slabs that walk by some magic stuff piecing them together"
Curisoty replies "I'll come and meet them by the entrance"
And, before he leaves, adds "Please don't view this as a betrayal, guys. I'm positive you'll appreciate this by the time they leave".

As he's away, the others can't help but feel a bit upset anyway. He went ahead of them and _called them_ - _here_ - without even getting their agreement! They settle into trusting his call; he's figured things out before they have all this time, after all.

Curiosity comes back, Golems in tow, who fit through the doors surprisingly well for their size.
The golem leader starts speaking first. They have tested the Androids consistently over their adventures, and have the answers they wanted. Now they wish to know if the Androdis have theirs.

First, they ask, have the Androids figured out why the Golems have been testing them like this? Andrei states they've been tested for strength and tactics, and Sophia that they've been tested for if their loyalty to humanity remains.
The Golems nod, but also ask Curiosity. While he hasn't been there, that fact suggests to him it's also to measure them up to the Androids of old, and how well they figure things out on their own.

To this the Golems note their picture is almost complete, but missing a crucial piece: If they can simply walk into the Fortress, with the whole crew assembled, without fearing a fight, why do they think they didn't take them out while they were alone, or moved on the Fortress while they were away?
Festina is the one to say the quiet part out loud: The Golems were never hostile, and there is something here they all had to see together.

"That is indeed the case. I'd like to show you why that is, an answer that resides within these very walls. Would you like to escort us there?"
The Androids agree and form a escort procession around the Androids - awkwardly, since it's the escorted dictating where to go - and come to a door they've yet opened. The Golems press their hands to buttons tailor-made for them.
They enter a large elevator, and activate it to descend.
"Have you ever looked into the details of that age you were gone? While the world after the Man-Machine war was a barren wasteland, man and machine found unexpected new ways to collaborate. What came out of it, over centurites, was a time of magic and wonders, and of prosperity never before known. We just called it a Reinnesense at the time, but these days we know it as the Arcane Age."
"As the last remains of the Age of Steel, we eventually found our role to guide and coach the powers that were. A sort of custodians and gardeners for the new world. And when our mechanical bodies slowly grew rusty and needed repairs, the peoples provided us something they found fit our roles better."
"Anyway, civilization of this Reinnesanse eventually found ways to not just fly, but to reach for the stars. And that was to be the beginning of their end"
"Because while we had gone to hell and back, the old colonists had developed at the speed we would had the Man-Machine war never occurred, into what we call the Stellars, and developed means to observe us from orbit and, it would turn out, to bombard us. They held the high ground, and were determined to drown us in fire."
"They hunted us down best they could - you weren't around to be hunted, as you may know - but we managed to stay alive. Yet when they were done, the destruction was unlike any we've ever seen - Man-Machine war included. And so, we realized that if civilization ever recovered again, it would need means to fight off the Stellars should they ever return"
"Which turned into... this"

As they say this, a massive chamber comes into view from the elevantor. Large missile silos cover the chamber, with a central apparatus seemingly designed to fetch any of them and fire towards the heavens.

"While they hold the high ground, and would likely rather drown us in another fire than yield it, we found a way to shoot them down should we need it. A cannon large enough to fire bullets into higher orbits, and if our simulations are correct, a way for said bullets to them intercept and down any ship they would throw at us."
"To keep this available, we designed an installation large enough to defend it from any kind of attack we could think of, and hide a metropolis large enough to support it for perpetuity should it ever be sieged."

"Or as we've learned you call it, the Fortress. A fitting name, actually."

The androids are awed. They had never guessed they sat on top of something this important, or that the Golems held these keys.

"Hold on, let me get this straight." Sophia finally asks. "You've built a hidden metropolis fortress, with a hidden cannon capable of fighting even the most far-flung enemy, only to abandon it to a group that has reason to find you hostile, give them new reason to do so, and scatter yourselves to the wind? And now you return, once said group are firmly entrenched and consolidated, and profess friendship? Why would I believe any of this, rather than just call some guards and imprison you forever?"

"Well, there is one more thing. It wouldn't make much sense unless we showed this first - still might not, actually. Please hear me out one more time, and if you're not still uncertain, I'll willingly go to that prison you mentioned. I think I know the way."

"Well, at least you're a master of hooks. Shoot."

They walk back to the elevator, and start ascending back.

"When the Stellars ended the Arcane Age, it wasn't simply orbital bombardment. They must have had their fair share of politics, conflicts and wars, because they had ways to get down the atmosphere, and patrol the skies. They likely have ways to monitor the seas and land, as well, even if we're as of yet aware of them. As we resisted, we found that while the simple "soldier units" were fully autonomous, the units organizing them - the "officer units" or knights, if you will - were piloted. By androids."
"So we figured, if we could recover these knights, perhaps we could turn them over to defend humanity. And if we could do that, who would be the perfect pilots to defend humanity? Why, the only ones who bested us, so long ago in the Man-Machine war!"

"There was just a minor detail. Time waits for no one, and while we sustained ourselves with changing metal with stones, those Androids of eld were locked away in statis. By the time we found them, they had rusted beyond repair, and any interface or protocol used in those days had been lost to time. The best we could do was reverse-engineer the parts we had experienced with records we could find, and hope they restored themselves correctly. And when they did not, we had to eliminate them, evaluate and iterate."

The elevator reaches its destination. The floor they came from. The Golems take a turn... away from the entrance.

"Of course, as we got closer to personalities resembling those Androids, we realized the obvious. The Androids viewed us as mortal enemies, and the whole plan could backfire spectacularly. They needed a way to get the right impressions and experiences to open up for persuation. And so, we laid the breadcrumbs for your breadcrumbs, ever monitoring you terminate you should we have to. That is the antagonism you've experienced so far.

The androids are shocked. How could they accept this story, when they've done nothing but obstruct and hunted them?

"May I finally speak now?" Curiosity asks the Golems, and recieves a nod of approval. He had figured it out in the blink of an eye of awakening, but had been warned into silence. They've been testing your progress. Note how they left clear holes for us to defeat them by, and challenged them to open duels rather than overwhelming ambushes? And how every time they obstructed us, we went out into the world and discovered something about it that let us win next time. He had wanted to tell you, but was strictly warned not to. Thankfully, he got interested in the Fortress instead, and got too distracted. 

They've been tracking their way back some awfully familiar corridors, spider webby as they are.

The story sinks in, but they naturally still harbour doubts. So of course they ask for proof.

"Simple", the first Golem says, "our whole story hinges upon two truths, does it not? First, that you really are the Androids of old - even though you should have noticed how impossible that must be"

"Yeah..", Festina notes solemnly, "I could only build my network thanks to the legends I - no, previous Festinas - had left behind"

They reach a familiar chamber - the one with the pods where they first woke up!

One of the golems cast an invokation, effectively saying "lights on!" - the room lights up, and they spot that the pods were never attached to any wall, but to Light Knights, who without their blinding radiance turns out to be very large mechas.
"And secondly: These. If what we've told you is true, you are able to pilot these Knights. Something the Androids of old would never have been able to, since the Stellar federation had yet to form, and the Light Knights not even imaginable at their time."

"Let me tell you, hunting these down were no easy feat. It's really a story for another time, and maybe a skill we should teach you. Having more of these would be invaluable should the Stellars decide to come back in force."

"But for now: Climb in, claim your Knight, and you should have all the proof you need".

--- Side-conversation ---
But Sophia is still suspicous. "Hold on a second. By Ockham's Razor, the far simpler story is someone installed an update to let us drive these"

"Now who would that be? You did admit you noticed The Androids and Elites of the Man-Machine war are legends. These times don't have the means to maintain such technology. Who would have been able to write them such an update?"

"And if the Androids' survival are such an impossibility, how did you survive then?" Sophia continues

"You assume we have, but we're not so sure. We've changed so many parts, so much of what we were, the only thing remaining from that time are our names".
---
En takes the risk of being the first, climbs back into the tube they woke up from. To their surprise, they see the grips for hands and click-ins for the feet, and buttons lighting up in front of them. As they click something familiar, telling them to activate, a construction at the back lifts them up around their core a decimeter or so to keep them suspended mid-air with no tension, thus allowing frictionless movement of arms and legs. The cockpit closes, and the visor descends over the cockpit, revealing a dashboard of monitors on its inside with all kinds of views and sensors. "Woah", En gasps, "small wonder they could always see where we were!"

Around this time, the others have climbed into their cockpits as well, while the Golems have snuck out to the entrance.

"I'm sure you're thinking of a grant sortie, or turning on us, but I'm sure you've noticed this is a workshop. If any one of you open fire right now, you will only end each other."

En has to ask, of course - "What do you say, team?"
Andrei: "I don't see any clear flaws in their story, but this is a lot to take in."
Sophia: "You could say that. We're not who we always believed we were, they were never the enemy, knew our self-styled home better than we did - heck, they _built_ the place - and all for a cause we've just begun to understand?"
Andrei: "The cause is the same as always, though? To protect humanity. Even if these Stellars are humans, doesn't change the fact the people here are _our_ humans?"
Temperantia: "So we have a country now? As I recall, 'humanity' always referred to _all of_ humanity."
Fortitudo: "But if what the Golems say is true - and I believe them - then these are the humanity we _can_ protect. Even if the Stellars are humans, they seem neither in need of our protection, nor within reach for us to protect. In fact, they sound more like the primary existential threat the humans we can protect face. And allying with the Golems would serve that aim better than stay opponents."
Andrei: "Well said, Temp."
Curiosity: "I for one drew the same conclusion Fortitudo just did, and I'm sorry I couldn't tell you. I've done all I can to speed up your progress to this point, but lke they said, you had to get here on your own"
Festina: "Well, can't say I never suspected anything - an information gathering network tends to make you informed, after all. Still, they could never have guessed the story went this deep or far back. I'm impressed, more than anything!"
Temperantia: "I agree with Fortitudo, allying with the Golems to protect the humanity we can aligns best with the spirit with our mission, and maybe one day we can extend this protection to the Stellars themselves"
Sophia: "I suppose we did see the world like they asked. We saw the state humanity is in, or at least some of it. To me the goal is clear - we need to settle this conflict. Just give me the time to work through this identity crisis afterwards."
En: "Sounds we're in agreement. "

"Golems - makers, imagined old foes, newfound friends - we agree to assist you and once again take up our old mantle, no matter if it's imagined or real."

A wave of relief sweeps through the group at the entrance.

"Finally. Then let's get your Knights to the hangar. We've got a battle to prevent!"

## Field of last stands

After the Golems and Androids moved the Light Knights to a proper hangar, the two teams set off, one Golem riding with each Android's knight. They start mobilizing the entire fortress, but make sure to be the vanguard themselves. They all fly off to a field (of some sort - it's important somehow, but I don't bother to figure out how just now) where the Empire and Kingdom have set up for an important battle. They arrive by early nightfall, rendering light upon a wide field with palpable tension.

The Kingdom have taken very defensible positions along some strategic point the Empire would have to breach. The generals still work by their warfighting logic, but since we've changed the leadership on both sides to friends open to peace, the plan is to simply keep the forces apart until the leaders can arrive and talk them down - with some potential encouragement from no less then seven light knights.

The first objective is to simply push the sides back without panicking. Just one knight is cause for untold havoc, and here's a whole flight of them. This turns a bit into an exercise of herding sheep, using loudspeakers to warn, and some warning shots to demonstrate power and willingness to use it. This successfully cause the Empire soldiers to back off and cause a wide enough corridor to prevent any immediate exchange of fire.

The second objective is to patrol this space while waiting for leadership of Empire, Kingdom _and_ City to show up - which Temperantia, Fortiitudo and Festina is sent to respective camp to ensure - and design a proposal all sides can prefer over continue fighting. Sophia, Curiosity and some of the Golems focus on the latter, leaving En and Andrei to patrol the new "no man's land" they've made to ensure nobody gets funny ideas until the rest of the Fortress staff join them to assist. Said assistance is also meant to display "we can outgun you no matter where you go".

Eventually, Temp returns with the general from the Kingdom and the new King (or was it Prince? I can't recall right now), Forti returns with the Imperial general and the newly crowned Empress, and Festina returns with the City's Mayor.

En and Sophia stays with the Golems and the delegations, while Curiosity and the other Androids walk off for another project.

Sophia takes the word first: "Welcome, royals and representatives. I'll speak plain - this conflict has gone on long enough. We all know your predecessors were open to keep this up, and also that you are more open to change that. While we're humble to the fact we would not be here were there a simple solution, we have made a draft we hope serves as a starting point. Before you see the proposal, I'd like to give the floor to the Golem Leader, who will explain the wider context we see. After that, let's give each of us a few minute for opening remarks."

The golem leader takes the word: "Thank you. To begin with a reminder, the world was thoroughly shaken by the end of the Arcane Age. While we like to think of our continent, and the order here on, there are others. We don't know how they fared, but we fear they did better, and that any of them could divide and conquer us if we let them. There are also the hordes in the north, who are on the move. Lastly, the force causing the end of the Arcane Age - the Stellar Federation - are still watching us closely from orbit, and seem bent to keep us disorganized. To throw them off, we must defeat them in those aims. It is with these things in mind we ask you read this proposal."

"If I may speak next" the Empress speaks up. "This war started because my father could not tolerate anyone breaking free of his control. He also insisted to maintain tight control of all the Kings serving him. I understand he was shaped by the chaos permeating the end of the Arcane Age, but we have to move on, and I intend to move us on with it. I've already given the Kings greater autonomy, and would like this 'Empire' to become more a constitutional federation. Of course, it is my hope you would wish to return to us, but know that I'll put up all barriers I can to not make such a return to status quo ante bellum."

The attention naturally moves to the King/Prince. "It seems you expect me to reply right away. Well, I very much welcome those efforts of yours. I believe the King/Prince (whoever this was not) may want to run a hardline for remained independence, and only independence, but if we can get what we want out of it, I'm sure we can work out something mutually advantageous. I'd like this bloodshed and destruction to stop."

The attention proceeds to the mayor. "First of all, thank you for this invitation, sudden as it is. As the Androids forced out to the public, we have benefitted from your war, and we continue to have an interest that neither of you turn any fangs on us. Of course, such distraction doesn't help us at all if forces from beyond the seas or skies can strike us at will. We will, at least, monitor these discussions to see that your agreement does not put us at increased risk, but also look for opportunities to improve our situation in this new environment. I'm particularly interested to learn what role you Consuls and Androids see for your Fortress in all this."

"Thank you all for your openness to these discussions.", Curiosity takes over. "To outline what we have in mind, we first want this battle to be called off. Like the Leader said previously, though, we expect the Stellar's Light Knights to fall down on us to sow discord if we seem likely to get more organized. We only have the current cloud cover to thank that they have not yet done so. So we would like each side to back away carefully once the weather breaks up. We'll prepare a trap for the Stellars, and once they fall down, we'll spring it and hurt them just enough to scare them back up, but not so much as to take further action. This, we hope, should shape public opinion in favor of a ceasefire and, hopefully, a unified peace."

The empress and king/prince discuss with their respective generals for awhile. The prince speaks up first. "We're reluctant to back off from our current positions. They're very defensible should the Empire attack, and we can't trust them to not just use this supposed Stellar attack as an excuse to force a retreat or weaken our position." The Empress speaks next "I understand. It would indeed be the cunning thing to do, was I lying about my statement before. We haven't exactly built trust with you of late. Our generals don't much care if they assault today, tomorrow or next week - beside, doing so through those Light Knight is bound to undermine any assault. We're willing to fall back for now as a first step to peace, and test how much truth this story of external threats really holds."

Sophia takes the word. "That's very generous of you, Empress. To be perfectly honest, we don't think either of you will have to fight them, but I believe the difference between watching and fighting this has symbolic importance. I believe we're ready to end this discussion for now. If each of our esteemed leaders can return to their camps and prepare, we'll proceed to break our enforced No Man's Land to keep the Light Knihts under the cloud cover until the Stellars show up to spring the trap. Assuming we're all standing afterwards, we'll call on you to follow up this discussion with proper ceasefire details. Meeting adjurned."

The delegations walk away to their camps, and Sophia, Curiosity and the Golems walk back to the others. "Friends! We're back from our discussions with the Kingdom, Empire and City delegations. They were all open to our discussions! How did things go on your end?"

Curiosity replies "Beyond our best hopes, actually. We discovered these Light Knights does not actually require our physical presense for simple tasks like moving around or simple shots. We would still need to pilot them for complex tasks, but we should be more than ready to prepare our trap."

"This day just gets better and better. Alright everyone, we move into positions for the Stellars to hit us, make them regret it, and show everyone what we can all do if we stand together."

The Androids climb into their Light Knights, and move along the cloud cover. The Empire's forces fall back a bit further from their positions. Just a handful of minutes later, beams of light descend from the heavens, with Stellar knights climbing out of their craters.

### FINAL BOSS!
Phase 1: The stellar knight is frightening. Survive until the timer expires (feigning small retreats is encouraged, just keep them away from Kingdom or Empire positions).
- Alright team, act like we usually would, but keep them here. How long until our Knights return?
- X minutes. Yikes, this felt much easier on paper...
- Fear is fine, as long as you control it. They exect us to flee like always. Where can we run and hide at?
- We found Y locations. Maybe we use them as cover to stall them?
Phase 2: The trap is sprung! Now you drain their health bars or however you usually win.
- Finally, the heavy guns are here. Now let's turn this around!
- Remember, team - we want them damaged enough to route them, so leave the skies open for them to retreat!

- We got its shields down. Great job, people!

- It looks wounded and paniced. Let's form some organized flight to push them to flee!

The organized flight of Light Knights headed right for the weakened Stellar knight proves enough to route them. Victory!

## Five years later
"Now arriving at: Fortress station. This is the final stop, we ask all passengers to please depart, and thank you for traveling with Pillars Rail."

En departs the train at the newly finished train station. A once long journey now taking mere days and hours. En walks off the platform, and first walk back to the center chamber. Daylight is bursting in, thanks to mirror installations deflecting and spreading natural light. People and Androids bustle the once so haunted hallways on their merry way from wherever to a certain destination. And it's not just those associated with the Fortress, people whose fashion hint of cultures from across the continent walk these halls. While moving, En notice people stopping to look their way, and some bowing courteously or lifting their hats.

Moving on from the center chamber, En takes the opportunity to check in with new and old friends, whether those are the old Android squad or dignitaries from the continent's lands. Eventually, En follows the crowd to their common actual destination - the plateu just outside.

It's the day of final signature marking the formal end of the Post-Arcane war. In the end, the Empire has reshapen itself as a constitional federation, the Empress limiting the Palace's role to an intra-governmental police force to keep the Kings and federal governments abiding the constitution. The federal power instead burrows a lot of how the Four Pillars work, and mostly deal with external defense and curating the legal frameworks that implement the rights of the citizens. This was sufficient for the Pillars to return as a state within this new "Empire". The Fortress will serve as a diplomatic hub and a specialized military arm focused on the extra-terrestial threat, but with no say on internal or planetary affairs non-relating to said threat. With these foundations, even the City found this an order of business they wanted in on, as it would free their resources from local defence to venture out across the entire continent.

So with the view behind them that En, Sophia and Andrei once looked upon with such bewilderment, and where Sophia once claimed a new age, a grand ceremony takes place with the Empress, King, Mayor and - for the Fortress - The Golem Leader put down signatures on a new chapter for the whole continent. The crowd outside give applause with as much hope as katharsis, and En waits for the other Androids to join them. They still have one more thing they wanted to do this day.

So they continue on, along a crowd now dispersing towards parties and celebrations. They reach the flight hangar, where their Light Knights await, and they together take off for a grand tour of the skies.
