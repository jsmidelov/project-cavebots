# The themes of "Cavebots / Robots in the Wild" (working title)

## One-line theme

Where there is liberty, there is hope

## One paragraph theme

This is a story of liberation.
From those who would direct by command,
From those who would engineer through incentives,
From those who would shepard with the best of intentions,
And from the eternal scepter of wars, overt and covert,
no matter if their motives are idealist, cynical or nihlist.

This is also a story of hope.
For where people are left to live their lives as they see best,
where people are trusted to make their own decisions,
and own the consequences of their actions, good or ill,
the world grows incrementally better day by day.

This is a story of outsiders who walk into a war between engineers, shepards and tyrants,
by becoming a beacon for liberation that shines hope upon the world.

## How substories connect to the theme

The story have these major sub-plots

- The overt war between the Kingdom and Empire consumes everyone's liberty
- The covert war between Stellars and Golems undermines legitimacy of owning your action's consequences
- Grand visions expressed in endless directives and orders from the Emperor and zero tolerance of questioning has made the citizenry zombiefied slaves
- A desire to enable perfect lives - expressed through various fees and support programs - have made the fledgling Kingdom a democracy where the power designs the electorate
- The city is the embodied example of the theme.

## How character arcs connect to the theme

### Forti

### Tem

### Festi

Festina's arc must connect with the lesson of the City, as she is both the first character we meet and her actions the root cause problem the city wants the team to solve.

### Curio

### Sophia

Sophia's arc is about learning how her best intentions can make things worse for everyone involved, and she has to consider both means and ends before acting upon intension. Or "the highway to hell..."

### Andrei

Andrei's arc is all about finding ways to resolve conflict with little to no coersion, and how that is better for everyone in the end.

## How the antagonists contrast or conflicts with the theme

### Kingdom

The King and Prince broke away from the Empire, and rule as a reaction to his. These designs hold wide support, and a new Nobility rallies people to volonteer in the conflict. The situation is still visibly heading off a cliff when our team arrives, and electing an outsider on the one problem the people can tolerate saying plants a seed of hope for tomorrow.

In plain terms, this is a critique of absolute democracy combined with welfare and nanny states. This draws heavy inspiration from old and current Sweden. This will require delicacy to communicate, as a lot of the customers may well hold these beliefs.

### Empire

The Emperor has delusions of grandeur and genius, and issues commands at every opportunity to make his will happen. The situation is depressing with little hope of improving until our team installs a ruler with a different mind.

This is a critique of absolute totalitarian monarchy with a directed ecnomy. Real-world examples are modern Russia or China. The easy part is making the case, the hard part will be educating anyone living in the free world what culture give them legitimcy and how they are tolerated where they exist.

### Citystate

Naturally, even in utopia, thre will detractors. There will be groups abusing their liberties for rebellion, demanding this or that "higher" goal.

This is a case for a liberal democracy with "nightwatch" scope combined with a genuinly free and open market economy. Rather than a real or historical example, this takes the trappings of Cyberpunk are subverts it with a utopian lens. This case will be difficult in so far as the reader expects this to be awful to such a degree they may not be open to the case being made, or take offense at the unusual notion of being portrayed as villains.

### The Golems and Stellars

The Golems and Stellars fight a war older than the (current) world itself. While nobody in said world really see it, and attribute its damages to random accidents or more immediate things, it still limits people's liberty and hopes. Our team can only do something about it once they have both tools and knowledge to see it.

## Structure and presentation

Let's draw heavy inspiration from recent Zelda games - Breath of the Wild (and probably Tears of the Kingdom, as it has a similar structure) with authored and linear opening, independent substories and side-quests for lion's share of the story, and a (granted, very complex) "finale" where everything you've done comes together.

Substories should focus on an area, be traditional three act structures that nudges the player to side-quests and have a tangible impact on the finale. There will, for natural reasons, be very few of these.
The side-stories should be constrained to one location, one (main) character and one conflict to be managable and have a no or a minor impact upon the finale (e.g. a nod of recognition, a cameo or some power up). These should be as many as I can manage.

## Challenges

Apart from making everything internally consistent, there are two known challenges to overcome writing this:

1. "Where there is liberty [as in, absense of coersion], there is hope" is at odds with a game system that's bound to be inherently about violence (and, by extension, coersion). The protagonists very capacity for violence carries an implied threat, which is itself coersive. To circumvent these ludonarrative dissonances the protagonists' capacity for violence must be expressed by a tool or weapon or indicator they can visibly leave aside or "turn on and off", and have strict rules for how it may be wielded.
2. The protags have with the Fort a wealth of inherited tools and knowledge lost to the wider world. There's a risk the protagonists come off being princelings drawing from inheritance rather than capable actors using what their liberty provides them. As such, I must have a writing rule the Fort must not be the solution to the world's problems. Solving wordly problems may aid in developing the Fort, however.
