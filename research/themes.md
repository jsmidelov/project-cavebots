# The themes of "Cavebots / Robots in the Wild" (working title)

## One-line theme

Where there is liberty, there is hope

## One paragraph theme

This is a story of liberation.
From those who would direct by command,
From those who would nudge through incentives,
From those who would steer with the best of intentions,
And from the eternal scepter of wars, overt and covert,
Whether the high-minded motives of those are.

To one where people are left to live their lives,
where people are trusted to make their own decisions,
and own the consequences of their actions, good or bad,
hope lives for a better tomorrow.

This is a story of outsiders turning the former on its head,
to make the latter possible.

## How substories connect to the theme

The story have these major sub-plots

- The overt war between the Kingdom and Empire consumes everyone's liberty
- The covert war between Stellars and Golems undermines legitimacy of owning your action's consequences
- Grand visions expressed in endless directives and orders from the Emperor and zero tolerance of questioning has made the citizenry zombiefied slaves
- A desire to enable perfect lives - expressed through various fees and support programs - have made the fledgling Kingdom a democracy where the power designs the electorate
- The city is the embodied example of the theme.

## How character arcs connect to the theme

### Forti

### Tem

### Festi

Festina's arc must connect with the lesson of the City, as she is both the first character we meet and her actions the root cause problem the city wants the team to solve.

### Curio

### Sophia

Sophia's arc is about how what sounds and feels good and right in the moment often make things worse for everyone involved. Or "the highway to hell..."

### Andrei

Andrei's arc is all about finding ways to resolve conflict with little to no coersion, and how that is better for everyone in the end.

## How the antagonists contrast or conflicts with the theme

### Kingdom

The King and Prince broke away from the Empire, and rule as a reaction to his. These designs hold wide support, and a new Nobility rallies people to volonteer in the conflict. The situation is still visibly heading off a cliff when our team arrives, and electing an outsider on the one problem the people can tolerate saying plants a seed of hope for tomorrow.

In plain terms, this is a critique of absolute democracy combined with welfare and nanny states. This draws heavy inspiration from old and current Sweden. This will require delicacy to communicate, as a lot of the customers may well hold these beliefs.

### Empire

The Emperor has delusions of grandeur and genius, and issues commands at every opportunity to make his will happen. The situation is depressing with little hope of improving until our team installs a ruler with a different mind.

This is a critique of absolute totalitarian monarchy with a directed ecnomy. Real-world examples are modern Russia or China. The easy part is making the case, the hard part will be educating anyone living in the free world what culture give them legitimcy and how they are tolerated where they exist.

### Citystate

Naturally, even in utopia, thre will detractors. There will be groups abusing their liberties for rebellion, demanding this or that higher goal.

This is a case for a liberal democracy with "nightwatch" scope combined with a genuinly free and open market economy. Rather than a real or historical example, this takes the trappings of Cyberpunk are subverts it with a utopian lens. This case will be difficult in so far as the reader expects this to be awful to such a degree they may not be open to the case being made.

### The Golems and Stellars

The Golems and Stellars fight a war older than the (current) world itself. While nobody in said world really see it, and attribute its damages to random accidents or more immediate things, it still limits people's liberty and hopes. Our team can only do something about it once they have both tools and knowledge to see it.
