# The Elemental Moons

With their origin in the Arcane Age, three prominent astroids were alterned to research, monitor and supercharge the three elements regular sunlight could not reach. The results are three gems in clear colors prominently orbiting within the astroid belt, spread around the orbital path in even thirds.

This mean they generally reach zenith on a 10-day frequency. Their effect on the world generally appears when the sun shines through them, in other words most notable around the equator at 12:00. Due to how these angles work the further from the equator you are and due to the world's rotational axis, this effect also moves latitudinally over the seasons, being strongest towards the north side around midwinter and towards the south in midsummer.

## Ares, the blood moon, the red moon

The blood moon dates back to the zombie crisis, and its effect knocks out any "blood-based" being exposed to the sunlight at the time.

## Neptune, the water moon, the blue moon

## Aphrodite, the grass moon, the green moon
