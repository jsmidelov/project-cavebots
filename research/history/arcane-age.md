# The Arcane Age (Magi√•ldern)

## Origins

During the Man-Machine war, man's understanding of the machines were severed, while the machines development of technology became self-reinforcing and sped up exponentially. No longer understanding the tools as tools, the men who came out of the conflict were more inclined towards mysticism as a reaction to the destruction, and used mystic language to describe these now alien tools: Magic, or "the arcane".

## Magical desciplines

In time, various schools of thought around the arcane developed, often inheriting sciences of old to understand these, such as chemistry, medicine, physics, econonomics or neurology. Some exceptions develped, using more mystical frameworks such as elementalism. These excel in different skills, and often complete each other, but much like the earlier sciences none can provide a complete framework of the thing they study.

## Political history

Arising out of such a devastating conflict, the founding agreements were designed to settle the differences that had caused the conflict. These treaties became foundational for the whole world for generations, until memory had faded so much the order became percieved as the problem rather than the solution. This spawned new tensions, some reactions, but ultimately a new compromise the world lived by for a few generations more.

Technology pre-dating the Man-Machine war was soon discovered, and generation unfazed by their historical developments integrated their magical skills into these old solutions. Among these were, of course, the Bipeds (now Androids) who served as excellent roles regular people either did not want to do - such as guards, soldiers, curiers, scouts, spies - or found abhorrent to do - such as engineering, sales people, escorts or assassins. This aptitude made them practical to mass-produce over the years, resulting in thousands of copies of each model.

## How it ended

Meanwhile, these magical schools developed faster than the social maturity, much to the credit of the Magisters (now Golems), and soon research stations orbited the world. This caught the notice of the solar federation, which struck down on the world with multi-month orbital bombardment before dropping down unbelievable weapons the world had nothing to put up against. Some managed to be captured, which was then studied at the best schools around, but usually with little success. This only ceased when any sense of order was smoking ruin, and little of value remained.
