# The Arcane Age (Magi√•ldern)

## Origins

During the Man-Machine war, man's understanding of the machines were severed, while the machines development of technology became self-reinforcing and sped up exponentially. No longer understanding the tools as tools, the men who came out of the conflict were more inclined towards mysticism as a reaction to the destruction, and used mystic language to describe these now alien tools: Magic, or "the arcane".

## Magical desciplines

In time, various schools of thought around the arcane developed, often inheriting sciences of old to understand these, such as chemistry, medicine, physics, econonomics or neurology. Some exceptions develped, using more mystical frameworks such as elementalism. These excel in different skills, and often complete each other, but much like the earlier sciences none can provide a complete framework of the thing they study.

## Political history

Arising out of such a devastating conflict, the founding agreements were designed to settle the differences that had caused the conflict. These treaties became foundational for the whole world for generations, until memory had faded so much the order became percieved as the problem rather than the solution. This spawned new tensions, some reactions, but ultimately a new compromise the world lived by for a few generations more.

Technology pre-dating the Man-Machine war was soon discovered, and generation unfazed by their historical developments integrated their magical skills into these old solutions. Among these were, of course, the Bipeds (now Androids) who served as excellent roles regular people either did not want to do - such as guards, soldiers, curiers, scouts, spies - or found abhorrent to do - such as engineering, sales people, escorts or assassins. This aptitude made them practical to mass-produce over the years, resulting in thousands of copies of each model.

## Crises

### The zombie crisis

At one point during the arcane age, there was a great plague. While the mortality rate was increadibly low, it spread to more or less every living being on the continent. The first signs of trouble were evident a day after, when the first life presumed lost awoke.

While it "lived" in something of a vegetable state the first few days, it gradually got self concious as more people went through the same process, and started lashing out like a ravenous beast. They were soon nicknamed "zombies" (because I don't want to invent a euphemism) Soon the first few mortaries had to be evacuated, and gradually more extreme methods of force employed to find a way to control the situation. Any injury made seem to heal itself, even if made the zombies were drowsy while recovering.

Meanwhile, the magical sciences led by the Magisters were trying to understand the phenomenon, and after some time were all hands on deck in order to find an answer, and then a solution. After some time, they had one.

In an experimental run, a team of blood mages managed to contain a small number, and "solved" the problem by setting them off to sea on a raft they sat on fire at the horizon.

This was no sustainable solution, however, so the powers that were, consulting with the Magisters, set on building the blood moon to knock out any larger outbreak no matter where it would happen.

The Stellar Federation looked on with equal parts curiosity and worry as the moon fixated itself in orbit around the astroid belt, but after some wait-and-see, they concluded it was a one-off thing and let it remain.

### The ocean crisis?

### The grass crisis?

## How it ended

Meanwhile, these magical schools developed faster than the social maturity, much to the credit of the Magisters (now Golems), and soon research stations orbited the world.

This caught the notice of the solar federation, which at first tolerated the curios action, then warned the Magisters to not repeat it.

By the third time they had enough, and struck down on the world with multi-month orbital bombardment before dropping down unbelievable weapons the world had nothing to put up against. Some managed to be captured, which was then studied at the best schools around, but usually with little success. This only ceased when any sense of order was smoking ruin, and little of value remained.
