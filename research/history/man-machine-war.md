# The Man-Machine War

## The first age

During the first age, mankind developed tools of ever increasing complexity and ability, unlocking potential in ever more people across the world.

Eventually, they reached for the moon, and then grasped at worlds across the solar system. Ever more advanced robotics could maintain ever more complex tasks, leaving a growing population to spend their time on the more creative and intellectual sides of life. Interterrestial portals connected worlds and moons, and ships into civilization-spanning fleets.

Of course, if something is too good to be true, it very often isn't. Those left behind the curve, those well suited for the now robotized and automated tasks, had ever less to lose, while the line between these people and robots taking these roles began to blur.

After a random incident, at the wrong place and the wrong time, set a series of unfortunate events in motion, eventually playing by its own logic, and tragedy started to unfold.

## The early stages

## Some kind of middle? Process?

## The late stages

## The End

By the end of the conflict, the stellar bases and colonies were mostly unaffected, and cut themselves off from the homeworld. They soon formed the Stellar federation to keep a semblance of order and coordination in a mostly inhospitable solar system.

The machines had developed beyond anyone's understanding, mostly disappearing from view

The people who remained found themselves relying on tools and materials simple enough to intuitively understand, due to a new-found fear of anything with too many moving parts, or scientific or engineering-sounding.
