# The Common Man

Regular people in this world likely have mixed opinions about the Seven Samurai. Some may see them as heroes, who are working to restore order and protect humanity in a world that has fallen into chaos. They might be seen as a symbol of hope, who are fighting to make the world a better place.
However, there may also be those who see the Seven Samurai as a threat. They may see them as powerful and dangerous machines that should be feared, as they were from past war. These people may view them as a reminder of a dark period in humanity's history and want to see them shut down.
Furthermore, there are also those who may not have a strong opinion either way, but would be more inclined to side with the powerful and influential figures of the world, such as the Director, the Syndicate, the General, the Prophet or the rogue A.I. They might see the Seven Samurai as a potential threat to the status quo, and therefore may be more inclined to side with those who are working to eliminate them.
However, it's also possible that as the Seven Samurai complete their mission and save humanity, they gain more followers, supporters and people who believe in their cause, as they fight for the well being of the regular people. Ultimately, the public opinion would be shaped by the successes and failures of the Seven Samurai, as well as the actions of their adversaries.
