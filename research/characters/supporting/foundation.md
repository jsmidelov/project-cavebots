# The Foundation

As the last resort when the ancient world fell apart, a foundation was formed to preserve and restore civilization (yes, this draws heavily from Asimov).

During the Arcane age, they were generally demonized and persecuted, blamed for the wars that caused the great nationsâ€™ fall, and deviants who kept secrets to themselves.

As the Arcane age itself fell apart, though, the renewed influx of members and added age to preserve made it a driving force in the chaos shaping the Current Age. As such, all new nations generally gave them free reign, hoping to gain the upper hand by something found in their domain.

They end up being the ones unearthing each of the Seven, even if only Sophia and Andrew were patient enough to stick around for Enigma, and serve as mentors to the lore in the early game and settlers - workers, engineers, doctors and scientists - of the City in middle to late game.
