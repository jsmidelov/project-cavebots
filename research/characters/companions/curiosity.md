# Curiosity

Curiosity is the “nerd” of the team, ever curious about how this world works and why. He has been provided the best scientific intuition of the ancient world, and a lexicon of knowledge to draw from. He specializes in putting two and two together, inferring the implied, and determining what is likely and not. Among the things he learned is much magical skills of the Arcane age.

## Personality

He can appear scatterbrained at a glance, and he speaks fast and with much academic jargon, but he is ever focused on the family's goal and planning most things with contingency plans upon the contingency plans. He can under-estimate the value of soft skills and the immesurable over knowledge and the measurable.

Within the team, he holds something of a “little brother” role, ever the target of others advice, and keen to display independence, to prove the advice is unneeded. Venues none of the others already cover provide a great fit for him, as the others would need to admit they can’t provide this advice, and need to seek him for it.

## Overworld

As Curiosity's specialty is putting pieces together at places that could provide clues, such as libraries, ruins. If he senses important developments or events are about to happen, you are like as not to find him there to observe ad chronicle them.

## Combat role

In combat, he carries a spell blade and an orb he found for channeling arcane arts. Due to the risks involved with these arts, he generally builds and channels power until a weak spot is identified and remains still for long enough to be a confident critical strike, and then blasts it with all he’s built up. This does not encourage mobility on his part, but the damage output makes up for it.

His curiosity means he learns faster than anyone else, but his mere presence also has a knack for speeding up the rate the others learn at.
