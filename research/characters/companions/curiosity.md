# Curiosity

Curiosity is the “nerd” of the team, ever curious about how this world works and why. He has been provided the best scientific intuition of the ancient world, and a lexicon of knowledge to draw from. He specializes in putting two and two together, inferring the implied, and determining what is likely and not. Among the things he learned is much magical skills of the Arcane age.

He can appear impulsive and scatterbrained at a glance, he speaks fast and with much academic jargon, but he is ever focused on the family goal, and planning most things with contingency plans upon the contingency plans.

Within the team, he holds something of a “little brother” role, ever the target of others advice, and keen to display independence, to prove the advice is unneeded. Venues none of the others already cover provide a great fit for him, as the others would need to admit they can’t provide this advice, and need to seek him for it.

In combat, he carries a spell blade and an orb he found for channeling arcane arts. Due to the risks involved with these arts, he generally builds and channels power until a weak spot is identified and remains still for long enough to be a confident critical strike, and then blasts it with all he’s built up. This does not encourage mobility on his part, but the damage output makes up for it.

His curiosity means he learns faster than anyone else, but his mere presence also has a knack for speeding up the rate the others learn at.
