# Temperantia (eller "Tem")

Temperantia specializes in demolition and explosives. He is programmed with advanced knowledge of engineering and chemistry, and is equipped with a wide variety of tools and equipment for dismantling and destroying structures.

## Personality

As a person, he is a stoic, displaying control and restraint, only using force as a last resort and only as much as the situation requires (when you are designed to blow things up, things gone wrong goes very, very wrong). He can put on a convincing aura of a crazed pyromaniac to get others on edge, but even then every move is carefully calculated. To keep the family metaphor, he would fill the “bigger brother” role.

In this new age the Seven has found themselves in, this makes him the ideal tinkerer and engineer, even if the materials he has grown to expect are a rare thing to come by. He needs to think on his feet, and restore a lot of lost fundamentals, but once he has rediscovered an technique of old, he gives the whole crew an edge. And on the occasion where they find relics of the old world, he can craft tools unrivaled by current standards.

## Story arc

## Overworld

Temperantia's demolition and explosives skills make him something of a “carry”-style character, initially relatively weak but an invaluable asset in the late game, as he becomes able to create entry points, disable defenses, and eliminate heavily fortified targets.

## Combat Role

Temperantia’s combat style revolves around preparation and iteration. Assuming the foe is unknown, he will start a fight exploring for weaknesses by throwing various explosives and area denial abilities. If better known the kind of foe is, the less of this is merited. Once a foe is well (enough) known, he can start exploiting the discovered weaknesses. He has to construct his granades during combat, up to a fairly limited cap, and bigger ones take more expensive resources, so he’ll restock and throw in iterations.
