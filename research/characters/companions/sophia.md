# Sophia

Sophia specializes in stealth and infiltration. She is programmed with advanced hacking skills and is able to infiltrate even the most heavily fortified systems with ease. In a world bereft of computer systems, this may seem less than ideal, but (assuming) the brain functions much like the ancient machines, it creates an ability to read and manipulate people, animal and machine alike.

## Names
Formal name: Sophia (of Ancient Greek for Wisdom)
Called by team: --

## Personality

As a person, she is caring and joyful, and functions much like a mother figure of the Seven. “Hell hath no fury like a mother scorned”, however, and if she percieves a threat to the team nothing holds her back from coldly destroying the source of this threat.

She has been acting out roles for so long she is starting to find it difficult knowing who _she_ is and who is a character she is playing

## Story arc

Her worry for Curio makes her act impulsively and rashly in order to free him, thereby making an unknown bad situation worse and throws the blame on her in spite of her best intentions. Along the journey, she struggles with and learns how to resist being carried away, and think before she acts. Towards the end, En is stuck in a similiarly tricky situation, and because she manages to stop and think things through with the family, they successfully resolve the situation.

## Overworld

She is also equipped with advanced optical camouflage, allowing her to blend seamlessly into her environment. Sophia’s stealth and hacking abilities make her an invaluable asset in the team's missions, as she is able to access critical information and disable security systems to allow her team members to move through enemy-controlled areas unseen.

## Combat role

In combat, she excels at predicting enemy strategies, calls out their coming actions, and uses coated daggers in melee and silent sidearms from afar. She builds rage as teammates are targeted by attacks, and can spend said rage on powerful finishers (much like Limit Breaks in FF)
