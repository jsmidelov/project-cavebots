# Sophia

Sophia (of Ancient Greek for Wisdom) specializes in stealth and infiltration. She is programmed with advanced hacking skills and is able to infiltrate even the most heavily fortified systems with ease. In a world bereft of computer systems, this may seem less than ideal, but (assuming) the brain functions much like the ancient machines, it creates an ability to read and manipulate people, animal and machine alike.

She is also equipped with advanced optical camouflage, allowing her to blend seamlessly into her environment. Sophia’s stealth and hacking abilities make her an invaluable asset in the team's missions, as she is able to access critical information and disable security systems to allow her team members to move through enemy-controlled areas unseen.

As a person, she is caring and joyful, and functions much like a mother figure of the Seven. “Hell hath no fury like a mother scorned”, however, and once angered few things hold her back from coldly destroying the source of this harm.

In combat, she excels at predicting enemy strategies, calls out their coming actions, and uses coated daggers in melee and silent sidearms from afar. She builds rage as teammates are targeted by attacks, and can spend said rage on powerful finishers (much like Limit Breaks in FF)
