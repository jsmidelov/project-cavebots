# Festina

Festina specializes in speed and agility. She is equipped with advanced propulsion systems that allow her to move at incredible speeds and make dancelike acrobatic maneuvers, coming off as a fish in the water even while airborne or on the ground.

These abilities provides her a preference for places where she can see a distance ahead, such as fields, subsurface or on the top of towers or roof tops.

She generally propels forward with electromagnetic “rail gun” thrusters and hooks, providing instant acceleration. She doesn’t have much in terms of ranged combat, but her speed makes her an expert in hand-to-hand combat, and reduce the difference between the two to something negligible.

In the team, she holds something of a “little sister” role. Usually cheerful and one to lighten the mood with a joke, and an intentional disinterest in political details make her the moral compass of the team.

In combat she is the first to be at the right place, and generally launches into flurries of stylish attacks while the slower actors ready up and explore for weaknesses. When the others are ready, she moves into an interception strategy to prevent the others from being interrupted.
