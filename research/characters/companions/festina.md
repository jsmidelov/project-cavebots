# Festina

Festina specializes in speed and agility. She is equipped with advanced propulsion systems that allow her to move at incredible speeds and make dancelike acrobatic maneuvers, coming off as a fish in the water even while airborne or on the ground. In pop-cultural words, she's basically a Spider-Man without who needs no Manhattan.

## Names
Formal name: Festina (lat. of "hurry")
Called by team: Festi

## Personality

In the team, she holds something of a “little sister” role. Usually cheerful and one to lighten the mood with a joke, and an intentional disinterest in political details make her the moral compass of the team. Her cheerfulness can sometimes go a bit too far, however, and she can come off as insensitive to serious situations or tragedy.

Part of this joy is genuine relief and delight to travel with the others again, but at its core there it also hides scars she got by being the first to awaken, and wandering the world alone watching the Magical age come crashing down.

## Story arc
Her arc, thus, to use hegelian dialect, is about growing from the thesis about light-heartedness, into the antithesis about growing up - e.g. taking serious things seriously, handling misfortune and shoulder responsibility.
And lastly finding the synthesis - taking serious things seriously, but also cheering others up and on.

## Overworld

Her abilities provides her a preference for places where she can see a distance ahead, such as the top of trees, cliffs, towers or roofs. This generally let her provide detailed insight into the landscapes within sight.

## Combat role

In combat she is the first to be at the right place, and generally launches into flurries of stylish attacks while the slower actors ready up and explore for weaknesses. When the others are ready, she moves into an interception strategy to prevent the others from being interrupted.

She generally propels forward with electromagnetic thrusters and hooks, providing instant acceleration. While said thusters can provide some manner of ranged combat, her speed and maneuverability makes her an expert in hit-and-go hand-to-hand combat. However, these advantages come at the price of armour, and a direct hits can be enough to throw her out of order.
