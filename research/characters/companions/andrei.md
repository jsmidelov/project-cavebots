# Andrei

Andrei (of Ancient Greek for courage) specializes in heavy weapons and artillery. He is equipped with a wide array of weapons, ranging from energy rifles to rocket launchers. He is also programmed with advanced tactical skills, allowing him to provide cover fire for his team members and strike at key targets with precision.

## Personality

In relation to the other androids, Andrei is seen as a mentor and leader. In many a sense a father of the family, he is respected and admired by the other members, and they look to him for guidance and inspiration. Andrei cares deeply for the other androids and will do whatever it takes to protect them. He also encourages them to focus on the things they have control over, and letting the rest go, inspiring them to be the best in what they do best.

His prowess gives him a tendency to underestimate the threat a forced solution bring to the others, however, and so is prone to solve problems with brute force.

## Overworld

His martial excellence makes him fearless, and impossible to put off balance, which makes him an excellent guard or raider.

## Combat role

In combat, Andrei can use every weapon with ease, from hand-to-hand and daggers to rifles. He is apt at getting and keeping the attention of opponents, and nimble enough to avoid most attacks. He also has a lot of the old worldâ€™s military doctrine in memory, which makes him an excellent tactician. When spotting what the opponent is about to do, he calls out how to respond. The better the team comes to undeerstand the kind of opponent, and what has worked on similar moves, the more accurate these calls become.
