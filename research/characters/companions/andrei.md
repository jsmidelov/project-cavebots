# Andrei

Andrei (of Ancient Greek for courage) specializes in heavy weapons and artillery. He is equipped with a wide array of weapons, ranging from energy rifles to rocket launchers. He is also programmed with advanced tactical skills, allowing him to provide cover fire for his team members and strike at key targets with precision.

His martial excellence makes him fearless, and impossible to put off balance, which makes him an excellent guard and spearhead. He also has a lot of the old world’s military doctrine in memory, which makes him an excellent tactician. When Pacem calls out what the opponent is about to do, he calls out how to respond. The better they learn the kind of opponent, and what has worked on similar ones, the more accurate these calls become.

In relation to the other androids, Andrei is seen as a mentor and leader. In many a sense a father of the family, he is respected and admired by the other members, and they look to him for guidance and inspiration. Andrei cares deeply for the other androids and will do whatever it takes to protect them. He also encourages them to focus on the things they have control over, and letting the rest go, inspiring them to be the best in what they do best.

In combat, Andrei can use every weapon with ease, from hand-to-hand and daggers to rifles. He is apt at getting and keeping the attention of opponents, and nimble enough to avoid most attacks. This can’t go on forever, and he would need someone to step in or assist if the fight draws out.
