# Fortitudo

Fortitudo (of latin, Justice) is programmed with advanced medical knowledge, advanced cybernetic repair and maintenance, and is equipped with advanced medical tools and equipment. This makes her adept at repairing and maintaining the other androids in the team, as well as providing poisons and hacks.

Her coded personality is something of a medical nerd, clearly desensitized to how others may find it creepy, but also very enthusiastic about healing others. She views the damage dealing more as a necessary evil to be avoided as possible, but quick and ideally painless once it has begun. As such, she finds Pacem methods very agreeable, Festina’s speed as useful as freighting, all while encouraging Temperantia and Andrei to act with restraint.

Within the team, she holds something of a bigger sister figure, caring bordering on domineering. As she knows better than anyone what would hurt them, she actively discourage the others to throw themselves at needless risk.

In the world the Seven were made for, she was provided a librarian-level knowledge of ailments that very technical environment could cause. In this rewildered world, she has had to grow into the resident botanist and alchemist.

In combat she usually stays at a distance, only rushing in to heal or revive anyone gravely hurt or in a Downed state. As everything takes time, she’ll prioritize as follows:

- Keep herself alive
- Revive anyone in a down state
- Produce and throw potions to anyone wounded
- Produce and throw damage enhancements

If multiple allies are in the same bracket, she’ll prioritize based on distance and relationship strength.
