# Fortitudo

This makes her adept at repairing and maintaining the other androids in the team, as well as providing poisons and hacks.

## Names

Formal name: Fortitudo (of latin, Justice)
Called by the team: Forti

## Personality

Her coded personality is something of a medical nerd, clearly desensitized to how others may find it creepy, but also very enthusiastic about healing others. She views the damage dealing more as a necessary evil to be avoided as possible, but quick and ideally painless once it has begun. As such, she finds Pacem methods very agreeable, Festina’s speed as useful as freighting, all while encouraging Temperantia and Andrei to act with restraint.

Within the team, she holds something of a bigger sister figure, caring bordering on domineering. As she knows better than anyone what would hurt them, she actively discourage the others to throw themselves at needless risk, even if following this appeal would sacrifice the team's goal.

## Character arc
Her domineering trait may come from care, but can make others feel controlled and constrained. She will need to learn let others do risky things, and trust they can take care enough of themselves to get through to the other side.
At the same time, her caring trait can make her sound timid or weak, so she will also need to learn how deter others from taking advantage of her caring side.


## Overworld

In the world the team were made for, she was provided a librarian-level knowledge of ailments that very technical environment could cause. In this rewildered world, she has had to grow into the resident botanist and alchemist.

## Combat role

In combat she usually stays at a distance, only rushing in to heal or revive anyone gravely hurt or in a Downed state. As everything takes time, she’ll prioritize as follows:

- Keep herself alive
- Revive anyone in a down state
- Produce and throw potions to anyone wounded
- Produce and throw damage enhancements

If multiple allies are in the same bracket, she’ll prioritize based on distance and relationship strength.
