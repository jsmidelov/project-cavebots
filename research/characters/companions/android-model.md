# Android models, common features

## Visible features

All android models come with a mass of fibers that looks like hair, and "anime-esque"-size eyes with overly large irises. These have a light gray color by default. Apart from that, the leading design principles for the models are "practical but attractive". They were designed for to fullful a role, but the designers also knew they must keep public acceptance in order to do so, and the best way there was by halo effect.

When their powers activate, the fibers and irises light up with a color corresponding to the elemental affinity of that power. As the power is used, the fiber color turns to an ink-like black, starting from the furthest out and moving towards the "root".

## Doctrine

The doctrine is what makes these very powerful individuals protectors of liberty and civilization rather than tyrants and brutes. Strictly adhering to this doctrine is therefore the first thing they all learned after they were taught to use their tools and powers.

The guiding star: Respond to threats and violence with enough force to deter, control and defuse the situation.

The android follow a protocol where you escalate threats in multiple steps:

0. No threat. Weapons are sheathed, holstered and hidden. This is the default position.
These next levels are in respons to percieved threats, ideally in proportion to the threat, and adviced to avoid pushing. Granted, in ambushes or sudden atacks these have to be gone past until the situation can be controlled.
1. Minor threat. Weapons are shown.
2. Medium threat. Weapons are unsheathed or unholstered, but not raised.
3. High threat. Powers are activated
4. Threat of restrained violence. Weapons are raised, position taken. Ready to enact violence at the next moment.

Requests of escalation. From here, a team member requests their leader to escalate - where they can approve, hold, decline or yield - starting from these conventional arms and up to the WMD-levels their powers can eventually do, until either party decides to yield or are defeated.
5. Melee and sidearms only
6. Semi autonmous fire
7. Fully autonomous fire
8. Small explosives
9. Big explosives
10. Anything goes
