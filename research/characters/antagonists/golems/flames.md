# Golem lobbyist

Work title: Flames

Flames is the golem agitator, a passionate firebrand for the cause he currently believes in. Of course, this cause changes with the requirement of the mission at hand.

In the current age, Flames is fanning demands to unionise the labourers of Archipelago city in order to undermine the current order and force the weapons manufacturer to turn their attention to internal worries over exporting them to the fighting sides.
