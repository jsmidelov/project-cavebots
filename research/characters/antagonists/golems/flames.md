Work title: Flames

Flames is the golem agitator, a passionate firebrand for the cause he currently belives in. Of course, this cause changes with the requirement of the mission at hand.

In the current age, Flames is fanning demands to unionize the labourers of Archipelago city in order to undermine the current order and force the weapons manufactorer to turn their attention to internal worries over exporting them to the fighting sides.
