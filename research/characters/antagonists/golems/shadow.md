# Golem scout and spy

Working title: Shadow

The golem spy scout is intelligent and cunning, but because of that (and their role) mistrustful bordering on the paranoid and potentially ruthless.
Shadow can make themself nigh invisible, and cast smoke screens to support their ability to vanish.

In the current times, this makes them wary of venturing out when the skies are clear (day _or_ night), and only moves outside under the shadow of clouds.

Uses these abilities as consulting spymaster for the Emperor of the Hidden Daggers, usually employing a vast network of survellience cameras and drones to monitor every inch of urban environment they possibly can.
