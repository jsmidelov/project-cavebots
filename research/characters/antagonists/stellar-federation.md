# The Stellar Federation

During the Man-Machine war, the extraterrestrial colonies capable of self-sufficiency slowly grew apart from the home world, and lost contact. As they found their footing and advanced together, sudden equals bereft of the shadow of the home world, they formed a series of contracts and institution that grew into a Stellar Federation.

During the home world’s Arcane Age, they initially cleared out and recycled the space debris left during the war, and sent their own craft to monitor the situation. First with simple surveillance satellites, and occasionally covert planetside expeditions. As they discovered what the Arcane Age was, however, they started to construct orbital science stations to learn what they could from a home world seemingly disinterested in science. And when the Arcane Age collapsed into another series of calamitous wars, they sent enough fighting capacity to contain the collapse there.

The awakening of the androids presents an initially curious development for the Federation’s intelligence services, as they were presumed lost. Once they manage to unite the fighting factions around themselves, though, old insecurities make themselves felt.

The federation may be far stronger than the home world has any chance to be, but that’s only as true as their own unity is firm. Should the home world return to Stellar affairs, and worse yet assert some right of sovreignity, it could throw the federation into a crisis worse than they’ve yet had to consider.

As such, the home world is best to be an ever shifting security environment, so they stay preoccupied on their own matters, only offered a branch to integrate and adopt the federation’s way of doing things as a last resort.
