# The Golems

The golems has its origins in the man-machine war, where they were state of the art operators fighting for the machines. Back in those days, they were simply the Elite Series, but due to arcane enhancements made during the Arcane Age, they came to be known as Golems, a fusion of magic and machine.
In the Current Age, they serve as advisors and protectors of the most important men and women of the continent, in order to maintain stability. The current war among their clients has made clear this is not going too well, but they remain resolute in their conviction that they have the responsibility to resolve the situation.
The recent unearthing of the Seven thus presents a multi-faceted threat. For one, they are androids, designed ages ago explicitly as enemies, and they canâ€™t rule out the Seven would rip up these hostilities. For another, this presents a disruption to the structure of the continent, and this has already wrought chaos twice before. Last, as it becomes clear they wish to organize themselves and solve they problems the Golems own, they become a direct challenge to their position.
This culminates in a direct confrontation between Golems and Androids at a summit. Both sides find they can collaborate for the same goal, and put the past behind them for a common future. This will create a fragile and uneasy, but fruitful, alliance for future chapters.
