# The Empire of the four pillars

The Empire of the Four Pillars (EFP) has an elected king and price with staggered 10-year terms (i.e. the Prince is elected on the King's 5th year). The King acts as the head of state (ie "executive branch"), with co-signing required with the Prince on issues of particular severity. Being an Empire, most of the work in practice deals with the squabbles of various Kings within the realm,

The executive branch is also restricted in terms of only controlling the public institutions indirectly, as well as only on the "Empire" level (Kings goes the same on Kingdom level, and so on downwards)

The "legislative branch" is where the Four Pillars come in. The Knights, the Intellectuals, the Merchants and the Labourers hold separate chambers, and are balanced to prevent descisions being made without broad and lasting public support. Every citizen has a vote in one chamber - those holding a job or task qualify for Laborers voting, tax net-payers qualify for Merchant's voting, those serving in the empire's defence and veterans qualify for Knight's voting, and those with positions in intellectual fields like arts, academia, press or clergy qualify for Intellectual's voting. Citizens qualifying for multiple chose one ahead of voting, and those qualifying for none can pass their vote to someone they trust.
