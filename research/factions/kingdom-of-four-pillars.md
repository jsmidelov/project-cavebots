# The Kingdom of the four pillars

The Kingdom of the Four Pillars (EFP) has an elected king and price with staggered 10-year terms (i.e. the Prince is elected on the King's 5th year). The King acts as the head of state (ie "executive branch"), and the Prince the head of government, with co-signing required between the King and Prince on issues of particular severity. This executive branch is also restricted in terms of only controlling the end goals of the public institutions on the Kingdom level (the same division also applies to Dutches on the dutchy level, and Counts on the county level).

The "legislative branch" is where the Four Pillars come in. Each of the pillars has their own chamber and election, and are balanced to prevent descisions being made without broad and lasting public support.

The pillars are split based off the differences of minds and priorities between various segments of the public:

- The Knights consist of active or retired personell in the arms of Kingdom's defence
- The Intellectuals are the clergy, academics, the press and producers of culture and the arts
- The Merchants are tax net-payers leading or owning commercial business or civil societies
- The Laborers are civilians those who mainly spend their time working
Citizens qualifying for multiple chose one ahead of voting, and those qualifying for none can pass their vote to someone they trust.
