# Progression systems

I want to design a progression system that enables the player to do more, and progressively unlock its complexity. Simple linear progression where you get higher numbers may be satisfying in the moment, but is pretty uninstering once you accrue heaps of useless junk. It should also be disconnected from aethetics, in part because the latter are useful for both storytelling and expression, in part because they always cause players unwanted dilemmas between style and power.

## Gems

Sources of inspiration include Final Fantasy 7 or 16 and Nier Automata.
The character's progression is shaped by specific gems, mapped to a magical element. The player already starts with some rules that provides newbie support, and new gems can introduce new or improved effects like weapon skills, spells or counter attacks, or QoL conveniences. Beyond Act 1, the player may need to trade between newbie support and these effects.

When a slotted slotted gem is used, it gains XP up to a cap. If the effect is active, the gain happens when it's used. If the effect is passive, it gains after every encounter or day in which it was used. At the cap, it applies a permanent effect, and becomes an elementally charged crystal but its active effect can no longer be used. Crystals can be used to create more powerful or complex gems, or sold off for good money.

## Job levels

Sources of inspiration include the Persona games and Final Fantasy 14
When spending evenings with job mentors, you eventually unlock job quests. Completing these job quests gains you a job level, which enables slotting in gems for spells or abilities requiring said job level.
