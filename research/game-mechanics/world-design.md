# Design Principles for the open world

The game environment should...

- employ lines to intuitively guide the player's attention between locations
- offer open exploration spaces and directed valleys through its use of barriers
- offer sufficient guidance to guide the player between relevant locations

## Introduction: What makes an environment worth exploring?

Basically all open world games use lines and locations to direct the player's attention, and thereby suggest where to go next. Spaces are divided by barriers.

These "lines" are often roads, bridges, or rivers, that directs the players attention along itself, and strings along points of interest.

The "points" are often locations the game establishes to be relevant for the game's actions or rewards. These can be large structures, natural landmarks, or clusters of smaller structures. These points can be rewards of their own, if they make an impression with the sight alone (e.g. visas) or are suffiently promoted as big deals up by the story's characters, hidden world building or both.

Exploration spaces can be contained with barriers, such as mountain ranges, walls or ridges, depending on what a player can do. The more powerful movement options the player character has, the more extreme these barriers has to be.

The map's edges will eventually need a hard wall for technical reasons, but the best maps are sufficiently buffered by terrain uninstersting to the player's interest - like desert, ocean or steppe - combined with zero "points" or "lines" there to let them suspend this disbelief.
