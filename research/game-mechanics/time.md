# Time

## Calendar on the Strategic and Tactical level

Time within the game on a "strategic" and "tactical" levels works in time, weeks and months:

- The day is the tactical time unit. It begins at dawn with the player setting off for a location, and ends at sunset. It can be spent by:
  - A main quest
  - A side quest
  - A character quest
  - A job quest
- A week is ten days long, and can be red, blue or green, with effects according to each element.
- A month is the strategic time unit, in which the player has to complete a chapter in the main quest

## A daily timer on the Operative level

- The day timer goes from dawn to dusk, and only progress when the player moves
  - Early morning started...
    - from the fortress are spent stocking up, preparing for the day, committing to a quest and setting the day's starting point.
    - from the field start from where you made camp, and can start earlier
  - The day is spent exploring or meeting the quest objectives
  - Evenings...
    - at the fortress are spent building relations with mentors and characters, and can unlock side, character and job quests this way.
    - from the field are spent making camp, which lets the player be out in the field longer, and continues the next day from where you made camp
- Exploration as a level, if you fail the objective for the day you get to replay the day:
  - Handicap: The player gets a compass pointing to objectives
    - not met after a day's restart
    - already met after a day's restart
  - Handicap: "hot and cold"-radius to objectives
    - not met
    - already met
  - Handicap: The player does not need to re-do met objectives
- The daily timer can pause on combat, as the player will need to focus on it without also worry about how much time it takes.
  - If the player gets defeated, they have to restart the day
  - Rewards from the day are reduced by repair and damages fees

## "Fast Travel"

A personal pet-peeve with open world games are how their "fast travel" system takes out the joy of exploring an open world, and turns traversal into a loading screeen. Of course, trekking throuhg familiar ground has no exploration value or sense of novelty.

"Fast travel" systems also tend to encourage quest designers to place objectives very far apart and encourage its use. So that must be a quest design principle: Keep the stories sufficiently geographically constrained to work without the desire for teleportation.

My plan for making traversal fun beyond exploration is to enable very few and sparse teleportation points, focus on some fun racing game mode to traverse between them and a stated objective (which must have been previously explored). This would be best employed to set off for a day's exploration, and happen before the day's timer starts.
