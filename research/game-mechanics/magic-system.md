# Magic System

## The elements

There are four basic elements that governs the magical system of the world: Blood, Water, Chlorophyl and Light. On their own they do little, but fueled by energy they can do most things.

## Energy

"Energy" in this context is used as the term is used in Physics, as an invisible resource that can convert forces into other forces. This naturally includes all from power generation and food to fueling electronics to the movement of living things.

## Light

"Light" here is suggested to refer to sunlight, but there's little reason to not let electrical lights work with this. In some sense, are electrical lights magical? :D

## Water

Water controls the inner temparature of organic and mechanical creates. It is the world itself in lakes or oceans, and routes of trade and exchange along coastal lines and rivers. As such, to manipulate water can be much like manipulating temperature and the world itself.

## Grass

Because "Chlorophyl" is clunky to use with any consistency, I'll simply use "Grass" or "greenery" instead.
Greenery is a sign of life itself, whether in form of grassy fields, leaves on trees, or plant and greens. As omnivores eat the greenery, let's say they too hold some of this "grass", but to a lesser extent, while carnivores have none of it.

## Blood

Blood runs in all organic beings complex enough to need energy being moved around.
