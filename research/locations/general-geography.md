Jag frågade två gånger. Låt oss se det första som stadsperspektivet. Kanske det vi ser först, då det är precis som betraktaren förväntat sig…

The world of this story is a post-apocalyptic wasteland, where the majority of the population lives in sprawling, overcrowded cities. These cities are plagued by pollution, poverty, and crime, and they are controlled by powerful corporations, criminal organizations, and corrupt government officials. The cities are teeming with advanced technology, such as drones, robots, and other machines, which are controlled by these powerful entities.
The rural areas outside of the cities are mostly wilderness, with small pockets of civilization here and there. These areas are typically less developed and less populated than the cities, and they are often controlled by bandits, raiders, and other outlaws.
In this world, there isn't a clear distinction of a major nation, as the world has devolved into more of a conglomerate of city-states, each controlled by different factions. These factions may be criminal organizations, powerful corporations, or even military factions, each vying for control of resources and territory. These factions often have their own private armies, advanced technology, and highly fortified compounds.
The geography of this world is primarily urban, but it also includes some rural and wilderness areas. The cities are sprawling and overcrowded, with tall skyscrapers, neon lights and holographic billboards, while the rural areas are often barren, with little to no vegetation and harsh weather. Some areas of the wilderness may have been affected by the war, such as toxic or radioactive, making it dangerous for human habitation.
Overall, this world is characterized by a high level of technology, advanced artificial intelligence, and cybernetics, but also marked by a sharp contrast between the haves and the have-nots, with extreme poverty and crime for the majority of population, and luxury and power for the few.

… och efter det landsbygsperspektivet, som en twist på formeln.

Sure, one way to put a unique spin on the world of this story would be to make the wilderness areas more thriving and habitable, while the cities are the ones that have been affected by the war. In this version of the story, the cities are irradiated, abandoned, and overrun by dangerous mutants and rogue machines, whereas the wilderness areas have been rebuilt and repopulated by survivors.
In this world, there are a few small towns and settlements dotted throughout the wilderness, where people live off the land and strive to rebuild society. These towns are often self-sufficient and independent, with their own economies, governments, and societies. They're built with survival in mind, harnessing renewable energy, and creating sustainable systems, such as farming and recycling. The people who live in these towns are fiercely independent, and they value community and cooperation.
The major nations are few, they are usually based on the wilderness, the biggest one is The Republic, a nation built around the ruins of an old metropolis, where a group of scientist, engineers, and survivors decided to reclaim the city and make it a new center of civilization. They have been successful in cleaning the radioactive zone and using the remaining technology to improve their lives and defend their land.
The Seven Samurai would be seen as protectors of these towns and settlements, working to keep the rogue machines and mutants at bay, and helping to rebuild the towns. These androids are viewed as heroes and partners, as they help the towns to be safe and thrive. They have a close relationship with the people, since the towns people have a say in the Seven's actions, and they work together as one team to ensure their survival.
This version of the story puts a unique spin on the typical cyberpunk setting by inverting the usual dichotomy between thriving cities and wilderness. The wilderness being the safe and thriving place, and the cities as the dangerous and uninhabitable zones. It also brings a sense of hope and cooperation, in a world where people work together to build a better future, and the androids are seen not only as protectors but also partners.
