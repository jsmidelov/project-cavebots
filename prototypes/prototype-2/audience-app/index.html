    <!-- The purpose of this area is to follow what's going on with the game for both players and test leader (i.e. me).
        This should be a tablet between the players, where up for one is down for the other, directed in portrait mode from the test leader.
        These constraints are critical for this prototype's scope to not blow up into a full-fledged multiplayer experience! -->
    <landscape-view>
        <p>The audience app is designed to be viewed on a tablet in portrait mode, placed on a table facing the test leader.</p>
        <p>Please rotate the tablet into portrait mode, and lock the rotation to prevent landscape from happening accidentally.</p>
